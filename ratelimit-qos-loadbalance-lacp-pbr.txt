	 interface,	by default interface allows multiple IP addresses on the interface. lowest IP addresses wins. 

		use	<preferred> keyword for selecting the address.
		use <primary> keyword at loopback address. if we have multiple loopback ip addresses.
	
	 static route- qualified-next-hop is used while having multiple next-hop, with differnet preferrence value.
